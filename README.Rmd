[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/mdlincoln/bigosm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mdlincoln/bigosm)

bigosm reads in particularly large OSM XML exports (>400MB) that cause [osmar]'s XML reader to choke.

## Installation

You can install the development version of bigosm from GitHub with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
install_github("dSHARP-CMU/bigosm")
```

[osmar]: https://cran.r-project.org/package=osmar
